Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

Project
---

P1-LaneLines.ipynb contains all the code, that need to be executed to create the lines on the images and the videos.

To view the images and video please go to the folders, "test_images_output" and "test_videos_output" respectively.

The file P1.ipynb contains the original document that was provided by udacity, and reflection.md file contains my thoughts on about the pipeline I built, and where there are short coming and where it can improve.

Setup
---

To run this project you will need;
1. Python 3.5
2. OpenCV libraries
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Moviepy
5. Numpy
6. Matplotlib

Once you have these libraries/packages installed, run Jupter Notebook and run the file "P1-LaneLines.ipynb".
